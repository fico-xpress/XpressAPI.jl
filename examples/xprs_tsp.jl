# Travelling Salesman Problem

Solves the classic travelling salesman problem as a MIP,
where sub-tour elimination constraints are added
only as needed during the branch-and-bound search.

Demonstrates:
- Loading of an initial, feasible MIP solution.
- Adding external constraints during branch-and-bound.

The example also illustrates how array indices in Julia are 1-based while
row and column indices in Xpress are 0-based.
